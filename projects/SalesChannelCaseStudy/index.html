      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>The goal of this project was to evaluate sales data and performance metrics to determine the most effective strategies for driving growth and efficiency. The analysis was comprehensive, going beyond the provided single data source to also incorporate seasonality effects and explore a budget reduction scenario.

      <h2>Data & Methodology</h2>
      <p>Overview: The dataset was from a travel company, providing customer-level data regarding acquisition cost, first/last purchase dates, total purchases, avg. order value and revenue, customer lifetime, churn indicator,  sales channel, and outreach date
         <br><br>
        Exploratory Data Analysis: There were some data quality issues, specifically ‘Last_Purchase_Date’ had some values in the future, so I dropped these from the dataset since they were pretty evenly spread across the channels. Then I looked at all metrics by sales channel, to get a high-level sense of channel performance and possible ideas for further analysis.
        <br><br>
        Feature Engineering: I calculated new fields to use in other downstream analyses, including: Days_to_First_Purchase, Purchases_Per_Month, Monthly_Revenue, CAC_Revenue_Ratio, LTV_CAC_Ratio, and Quarter. I also created a new field 'Holiday_Flag' to test for whether the Q4 holidays affect sales performance. Another data source I added was monthly inflation during all of the Outreach months, mapped to the last purchase dates. Also since there were many different performance fields, I decided to create a single composite performance score based off of 5 metrics (Avg. revenue per customer, CAC/revenue ratio, churn rate, avg. order value, deal velocity) to better understand channel performance.
        <br><br>
        Modeling: First I modeled churn rate using a logistic regression with channel as predictor. Next, I predicted the revenue impact for each channel, given a theoretical 20% reduction in budget, weighting the decreases in each channel based off of the churn rate of each.

      <h2>Analysis & Findings</h2>
      <p>The first interesting finding was that Events channel consistently had a drastic 50% reduction in their outreach efforts from Q2 to Q3, for each year throughout the 3 year time period. Next, I also discovered that both the Cold Calls and Events channels have a shorter conversion time (Days to Purchase) when their outreach took place on holidays.
          <br><br>
        From the logistic regression, I identified that Partnerships had nearly double the odds of churning compared to all other channels, though channel alone was not a sufficient predictor in the model suggesting additional fine tuning is needed to increase the power of the model. 
          <br><br>
        The budget reduction impact analysis revealed that Inbound Leads would be the most resilient to a budget decrease, while Events and Partnerships would be most affected.

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion & Recommendations</h2>
      <p> Cold Calls has fewest total customers, but 2nd best composite score. This suggests Cold Calls is very efficient and that we should increase their budget.
          <br><br>
          The holiday period findings represents a good opportunity to further increase Cold Calls and Events output. I recommened an A/B test that shifts a % of Cold Call/Events outreach efforts into holiday periods, to evaluate whether we can better leverage their increased deal velocity seen during holidays.
          <br><br>
          While Partnerships had the highest churn rate in the logistic regression, the model still had room for improvment as only 76% of the variance could be explained. This means I have not yet identified the best predictors so should iterate on the initial logistic regression model to fine tune.
          <br><br>
          Based on both the performance analyses and simulated budget reductions, my overall recommendation is to reallocate resources from Events/Partnerships to the other 3 channels to optimize budget allocation. This strategy will help mitigate any revenue loss and maintain revenue efficiency by emphasizing investment in channels with stronger performance.
